# solid-pixi

A WIP [solid-js](https://www.solidjs.com/) custom renderer for [pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)

## Install

```sh
npm install solid-pixi@alpha.0
```

## Basic Usage

- [Basic Examples](https://solid-pixi.netlify.app/)
- [Examples Source](./packages/example/src/components/)

```tsx
import { ObservablePoint, Texture } from "pixi.js";
import { Application, Sprite, useApp } from "solid-pixi";

const texture = Texture.from("/bunny.png");
texture.defaultAnchor = { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } as ObservablePoint;

/** 
 * Create a new PIXI application
 * Component props are 1:1 with PIXI.IApplicationOptions for construction.
 * 
 * Children will automatically be added to the closest parent container
 */
export default function TransparentBackground() {
  return (
    <Application backgroundAlpha={0}>
      <Bunny />
    </Application>
  );
}

/**
 * Included is a hook to access the current PIXI.Application
 * This is useful for adding tick functions, or accessing global width or height
 * 
 * Component props extend their respective PIXI class so;
 * <Sprite x={100} /> == new Sprite().x = 100
 * so most all props are 1:1 with their PIXI counterpart; like x and y below.
 */
function Bunny() {
  const app = useApp();
  return (
    <Sprite
      from={texture}
      use={(sprite) => {
        const rotate = () => (sprite.rotation += 0.01);
        app?.ticker.add(rotate);
        return () => app?.ticker.remove(rotate);
      }}
      x={(app?.screen.width || 0) / 2}
      y={(app?.screen.height || 0) / 2}
    />
  );
}

```
